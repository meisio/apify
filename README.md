# [apify](http://meisio.github.io/apify/#/)

Within [apify](http://meisio.github.io/apify/#/) I start to collect all the APIs used by me at a single place. In addition, apify provides AngularJS directives to write an info section and specific language/platform/client API descriptions. Additional tools such as angular-marked and highlightjs with (angular-highlightjs) make it easy to provide an markdown parser and syntax highlighting for a lot of programming languages. All API descriptions are hosted on GitHub and everybody can contribute to it.
